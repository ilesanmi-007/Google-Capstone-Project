# Google-Capstone-Project

## This is my Google Data Analyst Project in R

This is an exploratory analysis done on Cyclist bikes. 
The Dataset spans about 5 million rows.

## Business Objective:
To help understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently

The steps taken are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act
